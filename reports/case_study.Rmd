# 1. Executive Summary

Cyclistic, a leading bike-share company in Chicago, USA, operates a network of over 5,800 bikes and 600 stations, offering residents and tourists a flexible, sustainable way to travel. Cyclistic’s ridership includes two main user groups: annual members, who tend to be regular commuters, and casual riders, who use the service less frequently. To increase long-term revenue and user engagement, Cyclistic aims to encourage more casual riders to convert to annual members.

This report aims to provide Cyclistic with insights into the behaviours and preferences of its user base by analysing historical ride data. The analysis reveals notable differences between casual riders and members. For example, casual riders are more likely to use the service on weekends and during warmer months, often for longer, leisurely rides. In contrast, annual members demonstrate more frequent usage throughout the week, with shorter trip durations indicative of routine commuting.

Based on these insights, the report outlines recommendations that focus on increasing membership through targeted promotions and strategic engagement initiatives. Suggestions include offering limited-time membership discounts for casual riders and creating weekend or holiday packages to appeal to tourists and occasional users. Cyclistic could also consider geo-targeting recreational hotspots with ads, QR codes, and signage to encourage immediate membership sign-ups. Additionally, highlighting off-peak benefits through timing-based offers, sending personalised savings reports to frequent riders, and promoting leisure-focused packages like group memberships and discounts at local attractions can further strengthen the appeal of annual membership and drive conversion.

By implementing these strategies, Cyclistic has the potential to drive up membership rates and strengthen its position in Chicago’s competitive transportation market.


# 2. Introduction

Cyclistic is a bicycle hire system based in Chicago, USA, that enables users to borrow a bike from one docking station and return it to any other docking station in the system at any time. Since its launch in 2016, Cyclistic has expanded to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 docking stations across the city of Chicago. 

Cyclistic’s user base is divided into two groups: casual riders, those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes, and annual members, those who purchase annual memberships which allows users to benefit from unlimited rides. This pricing strategy is designed to appeal to a diverse set of users by offering flexible options, catering to both casual riders and frequent users. 

This capstone project, as part of the Google Data Analytics programme, seeks to analyse Cyclistic’s historical trip data to gain a deeper understanding of user behaviour, with a particular focus on identifying key differences between casual riders and annual members. By understanding these behavioural patterns—such as frequency of use, trip duration, preferred travel times, and popular routes—Cyclistic can gain insights into the needs and motivations of each user group.

The primary goal is to leverage these insights to develop strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, thus enhancing customer loyalty and increasing revenue. Maximising the number of annual members is pivotal for Cyclistic’s future growth and market positioning in Chicago’s transportation landscape.

Through data analysis and visualisation, this report will address questions such as: What patterns distinguish casual riders from members? When, where, and how do these two groups use the service? The findings from this analysis will provide actionable recommendations that Cyclistic can implement to better serve its riders and promote membership growth.


# 3. Data Collection and Preparation

## A.	Description of Data

For this report, Cyclistic's historical bike trip data will be analysed to uncover trends. This report makes use of data provided by Motivate International Inc. under this [licence](https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement) specifying usage rights and restrictions, located in a series of .CSV files made publicly available on the cloud storage platform Amazon Web Service (AWS). The AWS infrastructure provides a secure, remote backup that protects against data loss due to physical damage, theft, or localised incidents affecting the primary storage. 

A total of 55 datasets are available, spanning from April 2020 to October 2024. Each dataset is in CSV (comma-separated values) format and includes detailed records of every ride taken by Cyclistic customers. For this project, however, only data from the most recent twelve months—November 2023 through October 2024—will be utilised. 12 .CSV files in total were downloaded and stored locally for the next steps in the process. The .CSV file format is a highly accessible data format due to its simplicity, compatibility, and ease of use.

The data is organised by month, with each .CSV file containing trip data from a specific month from November 2023 to October 2024 in a consistent tabular format. Each row represents an individual trip, and each individual trip has a unique field that identifies it: ride_id. Each historical bike trip dataset file is anonymised with any personally identifiable information removed to protect user privacy and includes the following 13 variables: 

-	"ride_id"  - the unique identifier for each trip

-	"rideable_type" - type of bicycle used on each ride — classic, docked, or electric

-"started_at"- start date and time of the trip         

-	"ended_at" - end date and time of the trip   

-	"start_station_name" - name of the station where each journey started from

-	"start_station_id" - ID of the station where each journey started from

-	"end_station_name"  - name of the station where each trip ended at

-	"end_station_id"  - ID of the station where each journey ended at 

-	"start_lat" - latitude of each starting station

-	"start_lng" - longitude of each starting station

-	"end_lat" - latitude of each ending station

-	"end_lng" – longitude of each ending station

-	"member_casual" - customer type, indicating whether the rider is a member or a casual user


## B.	Credibility 

Using the “ROCCC” framework (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited), it can be determined that the data is reliable and credible: 

**Reliable:** The bike ride data comes directly from Cyclistic’s operational data, which is generally reliable. However, the data has some missing values, duplicates and inconsistences which will need to be addressed before analysis. As such errors only represent a small proportion of the dataset, their impact on overall reliability is low.  

**Original:** This is first-party data collected directly by Cyclistic, making it an original source, which enhances its credibility.

**Comprehensive:** The dataset has more than 5 million complete data entries and includes a wide range of information (trip details, user types, station data), allowing for detailed analysis. 

**Current:** Since bike-share data is updated frequently, the data is current. For this analysis we will be working with the most recent data to ensure relevance.

**Cited:** As a primary dataset from Cyclistic, there may not be external citations. Documentation on data sources, data collection methods, and definitions is essential for transparency.


## C. Methodology

In this analysis, all data processing, analysis, and visualisation were conducted using R. The following R packages were utilised to streamline the workflow:

**tidyverse:** A collection of packages used for data manipulation, exploration, and visualisation. Key packages from the tidyverse such as ggplot2 (for visualisation) and dplyr (for data manipulation) were extensively used.

**janitor:** This package was used to clean the data, ensuring consistency and handling any missing or malformed data points.

**lubridate:** Used for working with date and time data, making it easier to parse, manipulate, and perform calculations on date-related variables.

**scales:** Used for scaling and formatting axis labels and other visual elements in the charts for better clarity and presentation

## D. Data Preparation 

### Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process was a critical step in preparing the Cylistic data for analysis. The steps below outline the approach taken to ensure the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for transformation:

**Initial Inspection**

- Examined discrepancies in column names and data types (e.g., dbl, chr, date) across the 12 monthly data frames to ensure consistency before merging.

**Combining Data Frames**

- Merged the 12 monthly data frames into a single consolidated data frame for streamlined analysis.

**Overview of Combined Data**

- Used the glimpse() function to assess the structure and dimensions of the combined dataset, including column types and sample data.

**Removing Empty Rows and Columns**

- Identified and removed rows and columns containing only missing values to ensure the dataset was clean and complete.

**Handling Duplicates**

-	Inspected the ride_id column for duplicate entries, which serve as unique identifiers for each ride.
-	Removed duplicate rows, keeping only the first occurrence of each entry.
-	Verified the dataset to confirm no duplicates remained.

**Validating Data Integrity**

-	Checked the dimensions of the cleaned dataset to confirm the successful removal of unnecessary rows, columns, and duplicates.
-	Validated the member_casual column to ensure it contained only the two expected categories: "casual" and "member."

This cleaning process ensured that the dataset was reliable and ready for the transformation stage. For a detailed view of the code used, refer to the [accompanying documentation].


### Data Transformation 

The data transformation process was designed to refine the cleaned dataset into a structure optimised for analysis, ensuring that all necessary variables were properly formatted and ready for insights. Below are the key transformation steps undertaken:

**1.	Converting started_at and ended_at to Date-Time Objects**
The started_at and ended_at columns were converted into Date-Time objects in the YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format using the lubridate::ymd_hms() function. This standardised the date-time fields, enabling accurate time-based calculations and facilitating further manipulations. The data structure was then reviewed to confirm that these fields were successfully stored as POSIXct objects, ensuring compatibility with date-time operations.

**2.	Creating Time-Derived Fields**
To analyse ride patterns by time of day, the hour component (0–23) was extracted from the started_at and ended_at columns and stored in new fields, start_hour and end_hour. Additionally, date-only fields (start_date and end_date) were created by extracting the date component from the timestamps, allowing for day-level analysis of trends across calendar dates.

**3.	Adding a day_of_week Column**
A day_of_week column was added to capture the day of the week for each ride's start time (e.g., "Monday" or "Saturday"). This feature supports the analysis of weekday versus weekend usage patterns, highlighting how rider behaviour varies throughout the week.

**4.	Calculating Ride Length**
A new column, ride_length, was created by subtracting the started_at timestamp from ended_at, providing the ride duration in seconds. This field is essential for detailed analysis of trip durations and identifying anomalies, such as test rides or data errors.

**5.	Identifying and Removing Anomalies**
The dataset was inspected for negative ride lengths, which can indicate issues such as test data or recording errors. Rows with negative values in the ride_length column were filtered out, ensuring the integrity of the final dataset.

**6.	Final Verification**
The updated data structure was reviewed, and the first few rows of the transformed data were displayed to verify the successful addition of new columns and the removal of anomalies.

These transformations ensured that the dataset was enriched with meaningful variables and prepared for effective analysis. The structured and cleaned data is now ready to reveal insights about Cyclistic's rider behaviours. To view the complete code for these transformations, [click here].


# 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
